        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The main characteristic of this dish is the generous amount and variety of food in a traditional bandeja paisa: red beans cooked with pork, white rice, carne molida (ground meat), chicharrón, fried egg, plantain (plátano maduro), chorizo, arepa, hogao sauce, black pudding (morcilla), avocado and lemon. It is served in a platter or a tray.</p>
        <p>The current form and presentation of the Paisa platter is relatively recent. There are no references in the food writing about this dish before 1950.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the beans: Drain the soaked beans, add fresh water to a pot, and cook them with salt, a whole peeled onion, and a clove of garlic until tender.</li>
            <li>While the beans are cooking, prepare the hogao sauce by sautéing chopped onions and tomatoes in a pan with oil, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Fry the chorizos and pork belly in a separate pan until they are crispy.</li>
            <li>Season the ground beef with salt, pepper, and cumin, and cook it in a pan until browned.</li>
            <li>Cook the white rice according to package instructions or your preference.</li>
            <li>Fry the plantains in vegetable oil until they are golden brown and set them aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Fry the eggs to your preference, typically sunny-side up.</li>
            <li>Warm up the arepas if they are precooked, or prepare them according to the recipe if you are making them from scratch.</li>
            <li>Once everything is cooked, assemble the dish by placing a portion of each component onto a large plate or tray. Start with the beans, followed by the rice, chorizo, pork belly, ground beef, plantains, arepa, and top it with a fried egg.</li>
            <li>Finish the dish by adding sliced avocado and spooning some hogao on top or on the side, and serve with cooked sweetcorn.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
